    <div class="about" id="educator">
      <h2>I am an educator. <h2>
      <div class="about-text" id="educator">
        I am passionate about motivated, interactive education that takes into account the needs of diverse learners. Teaching at a Girls Who Code summer immersion program, and tutoring students on the South Side of Chicago has solidified my commitment to teaching math in an urban environment.

      <h2>I am a math nerd.<h2>
      <div class="about-text" id="math">
        20 people show up to a party, and each person shakes hands with a number of people. Is it possible for them to each shake hands with a unique number of people? To me, math is about the feeling you get when you make a subtle shift in your perspective and suddenly the answer is clear. I study math at the University of Chicago, and will receive a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics in June 2019.

      <h2>I am a programmer.<h2>
      <div class="about-text" id="programmer">
        Math will always be my first love, but computer science taps into my desire to solve problems. I believe that code is the future and that technology will shape our world for the better. You can check out my work on Github.

      <h2>I am a photographer.<h2>
      <div class="about-text" id="photographer">
        Photography trains me to pay attention to the world. Whether I have my camera with me or not, I try to notice my suroundings and appreciate the beauty around me. I shoot both digital and film, and you can find me at 500px.
